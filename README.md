### 3D Tetris:
The user will be able to walk around and observe the blocks in 3D as they fall.  They can use the hand controls to somehow push or manipulate the falling blocks.  The objective, as in normal tetris, would be to fill layers so that they can be eliminated.  The blocks themselves will be reminiscent to the original Tetris blocks, but will be actual 3-dimensional forms (i.e. more than just the 2D blocks with an added thickness) to make the 3D gameplay more interesting.  The playable area (in which users may move blocks) will be constrained with visible (transparent) boundaries.  The end-game height will also be visible.  There can be multiple levels with increasing falling speed and/or lower end-game heights.

### Interactive(?) Story
The user will be able to observe a scene or story as it plays out, with various elements and events of the story happening at the same time in different areas of the same setting (i.e. different rooms of a house).  In order to understand the whole story, the user may have to experience it multiple times, allowing them to view the scenes from other areas they may have missed in a previous viewing.  The story may also have an interactive component in which they are asked to make certain decisions along the way, which can affect the outcome of the story.
